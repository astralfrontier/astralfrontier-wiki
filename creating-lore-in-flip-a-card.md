This is a proposed system for creating and expanding a game world.

To create a lore card:

1. Propose a brief _idea_, e.g. "there are thirteen gods known to the world"
   or "the Bronze Horde is a bloodthirsty barbarian army".
2. If at least half the table approves of this idea,
   write it on the front side of the card as _fact_.
   Otherwise, write it on the back side as _rumor_.
3. Write 2-4 _questions_ that this idea suggests,
   such as "who are the individual gods?",
   "what is the Bronze Horde after?".

Questions should be an even mixture of _informative_ ("here is some information")
and _provocative_ ("answering this question advances the story").

The GM should begin with a few pre-written lore cards, mixing fact and rumor.
If the game is using [pole stars](https://astralfrontier.itch.io/pole-stars), all of the pole stars should have a card.

When the players find answers to these questions,
or when the story is in a lull and more lore would push it forward,
create a new lore card by answering a question off a previous card.
When players discover the truth behind a rumor,
or hear a rumor about something where the truth is known,
fill in the appropriate side of the card.

For example, if a question is "what is the Bronze Horde after?",
one answer might be "a nearby kingdom", which can be described via a lore card.
A question for that card might be "why is the Horde invading them?"

When possible, create a card that answers multiple questions at once.
For example, maybe the Bronze Horde follows one of the thirteen gods
and is invading the nearby kingdom because of some act of apostasy on their part.
Write a lore card to detail what happened.

You can arrange lore cards together,
such that the cards which answer another card's questions are adjacent to that card.
