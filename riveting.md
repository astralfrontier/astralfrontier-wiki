What does the [Reformed character](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2HLMIyJYJjWrRTa37BxSGAJcpD5D4Hg1g1hXDj2Tgc/edit?usp=sharing) I'm playing soon plan to do?

Right! Time for a checklist. In no particular order...

* Avoid Lifehack, Sebastian, or anyone else connected with the old gang.
* Finish this parfait. This is really good.
* Don't get taken in by the cops.
* Talk to Tegan Queen. I need some kind of identity papers.
* Talk to Finch. They'll know what Lifehack is up to. Maybe. Or they'll sell me out. We'll find out!
* Oh! I could go to school. I'm the right age. They'd never look for me there! After all, I'd never look for me there.
* Yes. I just need some kind of false identity papers... to get me into high school... hmm. Will this really work?
* Sure.

> Andrew Morenski: I used to be just like you: a short, horny, hopeless dork.

> Patrick Morenski: And now look at you.

> Andrew Morenski: Well, I'm not short.

Yes! I can be a total loser!

> Patrick Morenski: You left the outside world; you've got to orient your thinking. You've got think repression, think limits. Think humiliation and despair. You're in high school for Christ sakes!

Woohoo!

> Andrew Morenski: Do you ever ask yourself "How did I get here?"

> Patrick Morenski: Yeah, I used to, but now I just ask myself "How do I get out?"

This is going to work!

High school, here I come!
