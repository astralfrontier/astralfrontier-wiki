What are some options for task resolution in the flip-a-card system?

One factor we don't have to take into account is "complication": every time a card flips over, you've opened yourself up to introducing complications. So our dice model can be simple.

### Simple Success

If you flip a compatible card from topside to flipside, you succeed. If no card suits your needs, you fail. This is probably the most straightforward system.

### Compound System

Roll dice (see below). At your option, you can instead flip a card to automatically succeed. During playtest, this option felt a lot like Fate, where you can spend Fate points after rolling to boost the total into success territory.

### Difficulty

The GM applies a "difficulty number" (1-3?) to a challenge. Flip that many cards (or otherwise generate some number of successes) and you succeed. Some people like variable difficulties, some people don't.

### Buy Dice

Flipping a card doesn't succeed, but it buys you a die to roll, e.g. a d6. The BITD version of this says you start with 1d, and each flipped card gives you +1d (or +2d, or....). Roll and take the highest result. 1-4 fails, 5-6 succeeds, maybe?

### Dice Tower

You always get 1 die. It starts at d8. The GM can scale difficulty up (e.g. to d10 or d12). You can flip cards to scale down one die size (e.g. 12 - 10 - 8 - 6 - 4). Roll the die, and a 3 or less (or whatever) succeeds. Adjust the target number to taste.
