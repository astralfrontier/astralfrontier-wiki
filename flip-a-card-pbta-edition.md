During my earlier playtests, people commented that Flip-a-Card worked as a "better kind of Fate". But what about the PBTA fans out there?

These are just superficial ways to make a game that resembles some PBTA conventions, but as an exercise in thinking how to re-use the cards, I'm having fun with it. So here goes!

**When you're doing a thing whose outcome is uncertain**, pick up to 3 cards that would support your effort, and take +1 for each card. Then, pick up to 2 cards that might hinder your effort, and take -1 for each of these cards. Finally, roll 2d6 +/- the sum of these numbers, but no more than +3 or -2.

* On a 10+, the thing you wanted to do comes to pass.
* On a 7-9, the thing will come to pass _if_ you accept a consequence or complication - pick something off the flipside of any of the cards you counted up earlier.
* On a 6 or less, the thing doesn't come to pass, _and_ a consequence or complication happens - again, pick something from the flipside of one of the selected cards.

Optional rules:

* You must flip one of the cards from which you get a bonus, and you can only flip it back if one of the prompts on the back is satisfied (as normal)
* Instead of counting cards, your character cards have stats (distributed as +2, +1, and +0 across 3 cards, adding -1 for 4 cards). Every time you'd mark XP (e.g. roll a 6 or less), keep track of it. Spend 5 XP to raise a card's stat by +1, up to +3, or to buy yourself a new card.
