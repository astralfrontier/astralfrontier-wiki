**Day 15: Describe a tricky RPG experience that you enjoyed**

Yeah, it's Masks again! It's been interesting to play a game about teenage superheroes when one of the players is an actual teenager, and the rest aren't. He's been on board with the life-drama shenanigans that Masks naturally gets your PCs into. But it's always tempting for the adults in the group to think "are we actually playing kid characters 'properly'?"

I have a much longer, much more complex opinion on the general topic of playing characters who aren't "like you", and I spent time last night taking a shot at writing that, but I just don't have time to articulate it in the scope of a post-a-day community challenge.
