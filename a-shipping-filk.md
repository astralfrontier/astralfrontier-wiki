With friendships for PCs and things,

You can see what teenage love brings,

With your fangirl squee you're off on a trip,

With a quivering lip,

You can write your own ship!

Oh, oh oh!

Let's go write a ship, draw up a comic strip,

Let's go write a ship that isn't boring

Up on the fanfic sites,

Up where the writer writes,

Oh let's go write a ship!

When you get it posting up there,

All at once you're lighter than air

You've got fans of your stuff,

And it's never enough,

Now take heed of this tip,

You should go write a ship!
