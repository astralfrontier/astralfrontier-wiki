Most of the work today was technical, rather than creative, so I'll just have to announce that when I push updates to my card files, the results are automatically built and posted here: [https://astralfrontier.github.io/flip-a-card/](https://astralfrontier.github.io/flip-a-card/)

This should make it easier for people to review the cards as they're being created.

Happy new year!
