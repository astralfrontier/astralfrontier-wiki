To validate that I'm on the right track with character cards, I put together a spreadsheet where the Role & Focus cards are matched up. The results are a mixed bag, but that's kind of what I expected.

You can see the original spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GY0uCMhStUitjMacOJMu5SG800LbkhIUCt8gaw_zrdM/edit?usp=sharing) (link allows comments).

Conclusions so far:

* Explorer might get the ax, and get rolled into Opportunist
* Fighter, Performer, Opportunist, and Guardian all have something going on with almost all the Focus cards
* Sorcery and Conjury can pretty easily be folded together into Magic
* I replaced Intellect with Secrets and that's been fruitful
* Tech might make a come-back to fill the gap left behind by Sorcery+Conjury
* Influencer is a new thing but I'm not sure it's that different from Performer - if it doesn't work out, I'll need an eighth role
* Student is a new thing but might not make the cut, if it's just junior versions of everything else
