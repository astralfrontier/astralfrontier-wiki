Some notes on a Forged in the Dark game I want to create.

### Goals

* Present the players with a series of human problems in a slightly fantastical setting
* Drive resolution through bargaining, compromise, and empathy
* Let the story flow along the channels the players create

### Playsets

* The space station or asteroid (DS9)
* The 1930's island bar (Louie's)
* The isolated restaurant or cafe (Nightmare Cafe)
* The underworld hangout (John Wick, Hotel Artemis)
* The cyberpunk bar (VA-11 HALL-A)

### Setup questions

* What's ordinary about this place?
* What's extraordinary?
* Why don't people come here more often?
* What draws people here anyway?
* What are you doing here?

### Character roles

* The guest (this is the GM role)
* The mechanic
* The hostess/bartender
* The manager
* The barfly/The regular patron
* The cook
* The doctor

Advancement isn't just about gaining new abilities, but also bringing in bits of your former life.

### Things to do

* Learn what someone really needs (uncover secrets)
* Fulfill a need via connections
* Fulfill a need via ability
* Build, sustain, or change interpersonal relationships (friendship, romance, etc.)
* Gain inspiration by interacting with a comrade
* Flash back to a previous time in life
* Celebrate human rituals (shared meals, hygiene, holidays and festivals)

### Complications

* We don't have what they need
* Someone does have it, but must be persuaded to part with it
* Someone else has dibs on it - is this need more important than that one?
* They won't tell us what they really need
* Fulfilling the need will be expensive or emotionally taxing

### Interfacing with the FITD rules

Rather than Stress and Heat, characters can cause aggravation for the guest or the hotel management. This might force someone's eventual ouster, or drive a guest away.

Position is how invasive you are in the guest's life - are you pushing boundaries to help them?
