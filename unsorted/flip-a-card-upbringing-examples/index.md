Here's a few examples of how the [new Upbringing cards](https://github.com/astralfrontier/flip-a-card/blob/c1ff43ab479d27774fca877cf71c3e95ed3e5e66/card-data/01-character-upbringing.yaml) can create different characters.

**Elis** grew up in a family of nomadic traders, seeing the world from the back of a caravan.
He could have a **Cosmopolitan** or **Mercantile** upbringing.

**Rosaline**'s parents were fine artisans whose work was sought from all over the world.
Their house was a place of freedom and self-expression, where one's spirit ought to soar.
She could have a **Cosmopolitan** or **Unfettered** upbringing.

**Beroldus** lived in a tiny mountain village, and spent his days tending the crops and raising the animals.
He could have an **Industrious** or **Insular** upbringing.

**Tillote** was left at the door of a monastery, and raised by the ascetic monks who dwelled there.
She learned much of their ways, and little of the world.
She could have an **Insular** or **Strict** upbringing.

**Josef** was a conscripted soldier who fled after his unit was routed.
He remembers his discipline, but no longer has a purpose to which it can apply.
He could have the **Industrious** or **Solitary** upbringing.

**Auberee** grew up as the daughter of an ambitious lady.
She saw her mother climb the ladder of power through deal after deal,
and was taught to be a tool in her mother's ambition.
She could have the **Mercantile** or **Strict** upbringing.

**Louis** is a "Green", in a city of "Blue" and "Green" species.
The dominant Blues distrust and oppress the Greens,
and Louis has become a flamboyant rebel, leaving graffiti or boldly defying convention as a result.
He could have the **Underclass** or **Unfettered** upbringing.
