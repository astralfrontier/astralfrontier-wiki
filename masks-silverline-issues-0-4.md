These are the first four "issues" of the solo Masks effort I'm doing, called Silverline. I'm using the Masks PBTA rules to shape a story, to see how it works out.

* [Issue 0 - when our team first came together](https://forum.menagerie.team/t/issue-0-when-our-team-first-came-together/778?u=garrett)
* [Issue 1 - The Beacon and the Bull](https://forum.menagerie.team/t/issue-1-the-beacon-and-the-bull/783)
* [Issue 2 - Helping Hands](https://forum.menagerie.team/t/issue-2-helping-hands/788)
* [Issue 3 - AETHER and ARES](https://forum.menagerie.team/t/issue-3-aether-and-ares/796)
* [Issue 4 - The Cape](https://forum.menagerie.team/t/issue-4-the-cape/798)
