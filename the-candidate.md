"For the Queen" has an [SRD](https://forthequeengame.com/srd). I didn't have any really stand-out ideas for this until tonight:

You are the operatives surrounding a major political candidate. You're on the campaign trail, trying your best to publicize the best and conceal the worst, at least until the Incident hits...

FTQ includes 14 character cards and 46 prompts. What would I do?

Example Candidates: the young firebrand; Perfect Hair; the Establishment Candidate; the Likable Crank; others.

Example Prompts:

* You were brought into the campaign on false pretenses. Who recruited you, and why?
* Someone from the Candidate's earlier life wants to reconnect with them. Why would this be a bad idea?
* You heard the Candidate speak in a moment of honesty. What surprised you about what they said?
