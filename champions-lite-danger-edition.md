I'm ready to playtest one version of this game, using Danger instead of END to balance power use. That version of the game is here:

I'm using Git, Pandoc, and LaTeX to keep multiple versions of the game text, allowing me to easily switch between drafts, and introduce new or changed rules into each of them. For example, I have a stock version, an "easy END" version, and a "danger" version, and I merged new rules (Issue Covers and Letters to the Editor) into all three at once. That Git repo is visible here:
