People are sometimes bad at coming up with the right questions, but we're genius at coming up with answers. The answers we give expose who we are, and if we listen to ourselves, we often learn something.

Because RPG creation is often about creating questions to be answered at the table, it can shift our thinking. For example, say that I have a list of prompts for a place the players are creating. I can ask questions like "how is the land being used by its inhabitants?"

Alternatively, I can ask two questions. "How does the land serve the inhabitants?" and "How do the inhabitants serve the land?"

Many people can give immediate answers to the first question. How easy is it for you to answer the second?
